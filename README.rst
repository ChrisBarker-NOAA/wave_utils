Python utilities for computing properties of ocean waves.

Currently only linear gravity waves (Airy theory).

Included is the dispersion relation, and assorted related utilities:

group speed

celerity

shoaling coefficient

Eulerian velocities

Also a couple utilities for reading the data from NDBC wave buoys.

Examples
--------

There are a couple examples in the `examples` dir -- poorly documented :-(
